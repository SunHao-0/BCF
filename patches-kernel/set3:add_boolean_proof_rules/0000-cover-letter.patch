Subject: [PATCH RFC 0/4] bpf: Boolean proof rules for the BCF checker

This set implements the boolean rule suite used by the BCF checker.
It covers resolution, clause factoring/reordering, a set of streamlined
propositional rules, and CNF equivalences.

- Resolution: chained resolution over multiple clauses via pivot list and
  polarity bitmap; produces a resolvent (or contradiction).
- Factoring/reordering: remove duplicate literals from a clause and apply a
  sequence of swaps; validates literal equivalence and indices.
- Streamlined rules: SPLIT, EQ_RESOLVE, MODUS_PONENS, NOT_NOT_ELIM, CONTRA,
  AND intro/elim, NOT_OR_ELIM, IMPLIES variants, EQUIV/XOR expansions, ITE
  elimination on boolean conditionals, NOT_AND.
- CNF rules: CNF_* family to normalize boolean ops into disjunctions.

Hao Sun (4):
  bpf: Boolean rule: add resolution
  bpf: Boolean rule: add factoring and reordering
  bpf: Boolean rule: Add streamlined rules
  bpf: Boolean rule: CNF rules
